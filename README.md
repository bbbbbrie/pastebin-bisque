# Pastebun Bisque
The Pastebin Bisque is a small Python utility that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a user's Pastebin profile. All public pastes from that user are downloaded to disk. There is no rate-limiting. The file name provided by the Pastebin user will be ignored in favor of the short URL that Pastebin provides. This allows a single directory with all pastes and no duplicates and makes the original URL easy to reconstruct.
