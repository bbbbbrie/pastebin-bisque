✨ Overview ✨
==============

The Pastebin Bisque is a small Python utility that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a user's `Pastebin`_ profile. All public pastes from that user are downloaded to disk. Optionally, the pastes can be saved to a single `.zip` file.

There is no rate-limiting protection built-in. Read about the `Pastebin Request Limits`_ if you anticipate generating a large number of requests. The file name provided by the Pastebin user will be prepended with the short URL that Pastebin provides. This allows a single directory with all pastes and no duplicates and makes the original URL fairly easy to reconstruct.

.. _Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/
.. _Pastebin Request Limits: https://pastebin.com/doc_scraping_api#2

TL;DR - Scrape all public Pastebin pastes from a user.

🧪 Tests
--------

This project uses `GitLab CI <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/>`_, `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/4.11.3/>`_ and `Test PyPI <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/>`_ for testing. See `tests/test_pastebin_bisque.py`.

🏡 Local
^^^^^^^^

To run all the tests run::

    tox

Consider using this to run the tests in parallel:

    tox -p auto

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 90
    :stub-columns: 1

    - - Windows
      - ::

            set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append
            tox
