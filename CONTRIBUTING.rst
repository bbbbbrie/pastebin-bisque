💻 Development
===========

To set up `pastebin-bisque` for local development:

1. Fork `pastebin-bisque <https://github.com/bbbbbrie/pastebin-bisque>`_
   (look for the "Fork" button).
2. Clone your fork locally

3. Set up the development tools with one of these commands::

    pip install  bump2version check-manifest docutils isort pre-commit pygments readme-renderer
    python -I -m pip install check-manifest docutils isort pre-commit pygments readme-renderer

4. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. To do a quick test of your changes::

   python setup.py install
   rm $(which pastebin-bisque) && python setup.py install # subsequent runs

6. When you're done making changes run all the checks and docs builder with one command::

    tox

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pushing a new patch version::

  pre-commit run --all-files &&  \
  git commit -am"✨ Add it all" && \
  bump2version patch && \
  git push --tags

ℹ️ Pull Request Guidelines
--------------------------

If you need some code review or feedback while you're developing the code just make the pull request and ask `Brie <https://infosec.exchange/@brie>`_ to take a look.

To make it easier for your work to be reviewed and merged, you should:

1. Make sure that tests are passing (run ``tox``).
2. Update documentation as appropriate.
3. Add a note to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` describing the changes.
4. Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Go ahead and `git commit` and `git push` so we can 🤝 get started.

💡 Tips
-------

To run a subset of tests::

    tox -e envname -- pytest -k test_myfeature

To run all the test environments in *parallel*::

    tox -p auto

For quick development::

   rm $(which pastebin-bisque) && python setup.py install && pastebin-bisque

Installing the current version from TestPyPI::

   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pastebin-bisque==$(grep ^current_version .bumpversion.cfg | cut -d"=" -f2 | cut -d" " -f2)  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple

The `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple` is important because the dependencies on TestPyPI are out-of-date or not present.
